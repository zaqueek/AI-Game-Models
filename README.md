# AI-Game-Models
It's simple, it's just AI models for diff games.

Most of these are gona require some work on your part.
YOU are gona have to adjust screen size/position to fit YOUR screen.

WARNING SOME OF THESE MODELS USE DIGITAL INPUTS WICH MAY GET FLAGED BY ANTICHEAT.

Its ok if you want to alter/edit my code but be carfull i am NOT responsible if the code stops working after you change it.

I am also NOT responible for any harm this may cause like account bans, suspentions, etc.

All of these run off of python localy from your pc.
The simpler ones use CPU, the more complex one will attempt to use your GPU but resort to the CPU if the GPU is unavailable.

Each game will have its own AI model to play them.
